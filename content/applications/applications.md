# Why measuring muscle volume accurately is important ?

Muscle volume can be reduced in multiple situations such as :
* trauma
* surgery
* diseases or contexts affecting the muscle directly (neuromuscular diseases) or indirectly (heart failure, respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases, aging, inactivity).

Muscle volume recovery is a key objective during rehabilitation or amateur or professional sports training. Initial assessment and monitoring of muscle volume with portable methods allows for improved individualization and effectiveness of intervention programs.

It is also key to be able to assess and track muscle volume in a targeted area of the body such as the thigh, leg, forearm, and arm.

In clinical research, tracking muscle volume is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of therapies targeting muscle or affecting muscle health.
