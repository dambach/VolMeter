## Why assessing muscle volume is important ?
Muscle volume is strongly related to the strength muscle can produce and is thus a strong determinant of physical capacities. However muscle volume can be reduced in multiple situations such as :
  * trauma
  * surgery
  * diseases or contexts affecting the muscle directly (neuromuscular diseases) or indirectly (heart failure, respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases, aging, inactivity).

## What is VolMeter ?

VolMeter is a technological solution that allows the evaluation and monitoring of volume in a targeted area of the body. Leveraging a patented technology, VolMeter offers solutions adapted for diagnosis, rehabilitation, sports training and clinical research.

VolMeter has been demonstrated to produce accurate measurement of muscle volume in reference to magnetic resonnance imaging that is the gold standard method. Importantly, accurate measurement can also be obtained in patients with severe muscle wasting and degeneration such as in inclusion body myositis.

## How VolMeter works ?
VolMeter is based on the study of the electrical properties of the human body and offers a unique solution to accurately measure muscle volume in a targeted region of the body.

## Why is it better than standard bioelectrical analysis and other approaches ?

Standard bioelectrical analysis is great for the assessment whole body composition however it cannot provide absolute values of muscle volume within a specific region of the body such as thigh or forearm.
Local bioelectrical analysis methods do not provide estimations of muscle volume.
